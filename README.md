# Who am I? 

Hi, I’m Syed — the kind of person who can’t use technology without trying to understand what’s happening underneath it.
Linux is where that curiosity turned into a **full-on obsession**, and it’s what pushed me deeper into systems, security, and how the whole stack works behind the scenes.

I enjoy exploring the connections between **Linux internals**, **security practices**, and **cloud technologies** — not just the tools themselves, but the principles and reasoning behind them. Whether it’s system behavior, configuration logic, or frameworks like **ISO 27001**, NIST SP 800-53, and CIS benchmarks, I love digging into the why.

My learning style is simple:
experiment → break → investigate → fix → pretend Microsoft caused the problem __(kidding… mostly)__.
That cycle has shaped how I approach troubleshooting and how I build: calm, methodical, and grounded in technical depth.

At the core, I’m someone who values strong fundamentals and continuous improvement. I like making systems cleaner, more secure, and more predictable — and leaving things better than I found them, whether that’s infrastructure, documentation, or a messy config someone swore would “never break.”
